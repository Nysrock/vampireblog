Alucard (アーカード Ākādo (English pronunciation "Alucard")) 
is a fictional character and the anti-hero protagonist of the Hellsing manga and anime series created by Kouta Hirano. 
He is a vampire and is devoted entirely to the current head of the Hellsing family 
(Integra Hellsing during the timeline of the story) and good friends with Walter. 
He also feels admiration towards his fledgling, Seras Victoria. 
Alucard works with the Hellsing Organization against other vampires and evil forces. 
He fights with ferocity and cruelty, sometimes only killing until his target has been disabled and humiliated, 
while frequently allowing enemies more than one chance to kill him (though he seeks only to be killed by a human, 
having grown bored of immortality and life). 

This is it.
